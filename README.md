## DTAmc 

DTAmc is an R package to perform statistical analysis for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (DTA) studies
with co-primary endpoints sensitivity and specificity. In particular,
it allows for multiplicity corrections when the diagnostic accuracy of multiple 
index tests (or candidate models) is investigated simultaneously. Also applicable in the
extended case of more than two subpopulations of interest (i.e. multi-class classification problems).

NOTE: THIS IS AN EARLY DEVELOPMENT VERSION. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SERIOUS APPLICATION.
